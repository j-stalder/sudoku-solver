# sudoku-solver
This short Jupyter Notebook contains a Sudoku-solver using a simple backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is quite a popular puzzle that is often found in magazines and newspapers. The rules are as followed: in a 9x9 matrix the number 1 to 9 should only be filed in once per column and per row. Further the board is divided in 9 little 3x3 matrices which have to include as well all numbers from 1-9.
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems. It abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

## Getting started and prerequisites
The examples given in this course are made with the Jupyter-Notebook of the Anaconda Distribution using Python 3.x.x. In particular the numpy package is used in order to solve the puzzle.

### Installation of Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook)
 Once your done with installing the Gurobi solver visit  https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ and download the Anaconda distribution for your system (this course is based on Python 3.7).
