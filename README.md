# sudoku-solver
This short Jupyter Notebook contains a Sudoku-solver using a simple backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is quite a popular puzzle that is often found in magazines and newspapers. The rules are as followed: in a 9x9 matrix the number 1 to 9 should only be filed in once per column and per row. Further the board is divided in 9 little 3x3 matrices which have to include all numbers from 1-9.

## Getting started and prerequisites
